# MSTU 5003 Design Document -Ziyun Tao
## Topic
The subject is to build a Chinese learning website for people who want to learn basic Chinese online. The website begins from the most basic knowledge including pronunciation, characters and discussion forum. This site also has some function like dictionary, test and good apps recommendation. So the advance learns can also use this site to help their study and gain some useful resources.
## Problem
There are a lot of websites about learning Chinese online or offline. But most of them doesn’t cover the basic part—especially pinyin and characters. They start from everyday conversation or lessons but talk little about the how to read or write Chinese characters. So I think it is necessary to include the very basic part for learns within few or no learning experience.
My website focus on the pinyin, writing, pronunciations and some popular vocabulary. Students can use the quiz to assess their learning. Also, if they have any questions about the lessons, they can post to a discussion forum and help each other. It is also a learning process through asking and solving problems. Therefore it is more comprehensive and progressive for the beginners and advanced learners.
## Target Audience
This website is for students within very limited or no Chinese skills and focus on the beginning stage. The sites are open to anyone who are interested in Chinese learning!
